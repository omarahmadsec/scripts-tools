# 🛠️ Cybersecurity Scripts & Tools

This repository contains small but powerful tools I’ve built to automate defensive security tasks like log parsing, alert enrichment, and threat intelligence lookups.

## 📂 Tools

### `log_parser/`
Scripts to extract and analyze fields from Windows Event Logs, firewall logs, and syslogs.

### `alert_enricher/`
Adds extra context to alerts using open-source threat intelligence APIs (e.g. VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB).

### `ip_tools/`
Simple IP lookup tools for WHOIS, geolocation, and blocklist checking.

### `utils/`
Templates, helpers, or smaller reusable scripts.

### `examples/`
Logs and test data used to demonstrate the tools.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Python scripting for security automation
- API integration (e.g., VirusTotal, Shodan)
- Data parsing (JSON, CSV, logs)
- Real-world Blue Team workflows

## 🔄 Status

- ✅ Basic log parser complete
- 🔜 Expanding alert enrichment tools
- 🧪 Testing on sample logs
